> What was the single most useful or meaningful thing you learned
in this experience?

The **most** useful thing that I learned from this course is how to build a website.  In Application of Databases, I learned how to build a website and several different technologies commonly used when doing so.  However, we didn't learn how to put a large-scale project together - until now.  Thanks to the ambitious nature of my group, we didn't use the rudimentary approach found in Databases; we built a CRUD application from the ground up taking full advantage of Flask.   

> What knowledge or skills acquired or developed while in college
were most useful in this experience?

I was happy with learning how to use Bootstrap this semester, and HTML/CSS is starting to become a little easier than it was before.  Knowing how to use these technologies before starting on the project helped considerably with the front end work of the website. 

> What problems or struggles did you encounter in this experience,
if any? If so, how did you solve them?

I had some huge problems with half of my team not contributing to the project.  There isn't much you can do in the situation; it's an issue with group projects in college.  However, my other team member and I started to delegate some tasks for the non-contributing members near the end of the project cycle so that the two of us wouldn't have to do everything.  It seemed like the only thing we could have done here was assign smaller, less-important work in case it wouldn't get done.    

> In what areas would you most like to continue to strengthen your
knowledge or skills?

I'm driven to learn more about how to stucture large-scale projects, especially in or around application/game development.  I can pick up development in a large project, but don't feel completely confident yet in how to go about creating that large project without guidance/research.  

> Describe something significant that you have learned about
yourself in this experience.

I still have not learned to be assertive enough.  While it's true that I did become assertive during the end phase of development, it was perhaps too late to make enough of a difference.  Context is everything, though.  One of our group members was experiencing a loss in the family.  It's really tricky dealing with a situation like this while not being employeed.

how?

No, it has not.
