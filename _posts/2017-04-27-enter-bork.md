## A text adventure game engine that runs demakes of Zork.

One of my favorite projects I made while at Mary Wash was bork.  I love ye old text adventures of yore, and creating an engine that can generate such games was basically the coolest thing ever.  This was created way back in Object-Oriented Design, which was young in my Computer Science endeavors.  

### Design

The engine was written entirely in Java.  Not only did the assignment introduce Object-Oriented concepts, but it was the first project where we had to work with other people using git and linux.  It can read in any .txt file formatted as so:



This engine also features locked doors, combat, and enemy NPC's.
