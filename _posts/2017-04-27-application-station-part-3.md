## A form management system for the College of Education Student Teaching Program.

***At long last***, the Application Station.

### The Project

> This project is an application designed to allow for a streamlined student-teaching
program registration experience to both the students in the program and the faculty that
oversee the process. The largest benefit of this project will be the switch from physical
applications to digital, as the website shall be hosted on a server provided by the
University. Given that a student has a UMW account, they shall be able to register and fill
out any applications for the CoE program that they need to.

By far the largest project undertaken at UMW, I'm proud to say that we did manage to complete a working piece of software.  Our team took on am ambitious approach to the design of the project.  We used several new technologies in addition to tools we were familiar with, including:
