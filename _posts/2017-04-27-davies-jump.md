## A game created for GBA hardware, runnable on GBA emulators.  

## Up, up, and up you'll go, where will you stop - Dr. Finlayson - no!!! 

***Davies Jump*** is a endless jumper designed for the GBA.  It stars the infamous Professor Davies as he ascends into space all while trying to avoid the clutches of Dr. Finlayson, a floating space rock.  It isn't difficult to set up if you follow the instructions on the [repository](https://github.com/acarlyle/davies-jump) page.  

## The Project

The project specifications were simple.  We needed to create a GBA game that included:

* A scolling, tiled background
* A minimum of 2 sprites
* 2 functions that were written in assembly code

Writing a game for the GBA is no walk in the park.  Not only is it lacking an operating system, but it has comparably low specs to the smartphones of today.    

## Reflections

If I had to do this project again, I would want to do more with it.  I loved working on it, and I'd want to take it to the next level.  It was difficult to put together, and I feel like a full-sized GBA game would be  quite the challenge.
