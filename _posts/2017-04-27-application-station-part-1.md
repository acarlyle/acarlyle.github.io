## A Vision of Words

What better way to end an educational journey than by using all of what we've learned to build real software for a real client?  This posts highlights the inception of that process: generating documentation to build the system.

At this point we had written requirements documents, and had just then been placed on our **implementation** teams.  This the team that would be responsible for a number of items, including:


* Generating a Project Plan Document
* Generating a Testing Plan document
* Delivering a finished product by the end of the semester

### Our Project

Our project seemed like a doable one:  We were to build a web application that would be used by the UMW College of Education department.  Students in the student teaching program at UMW would be able to fill out applications on the website, and the faculty that oversees the process would be able to export that information.  The base goal was to reduce the overhead of needing to enter all of that information manually.  By digitizing the process, the overhead of the faculty would be significantly reduced.

In this early stage, we thought we had plenty of time to take on the world.  And so, we assembled together to make sense of the following requirements document and put together a plan for our project.

From writing the Project Plan, we learned that there are a lot of intricacies involved in our project, especially with the three seperate application forms.  We needed to schedule frequent meetings with our client in order to ensure complete understanding of the system.

If we needed to do this process again, it would be a good idea to immediately prioritze requirements and decide as a team which requirements wouldn't make the cut.
